# Overkiz (by Somfy) - Home Assistant

Custom component for Home Assistant to interact with smart devices via the Overkiz platform.

> Home Assistant 2022.2 will have the Overkiz (by Somfy) integration available in core. Most platforms are supported, except for siren, climate and water heater. Please use **one** of the integrations (core vs custom), to avoid calling Somfy's servers from two separate integrations and to avoid authentication issues.

## Supported hubs

- Atlantic Cozytouch
- Hitachi Hi Kumo
- Nexity EugÃ©nie
- Rexel Energeasy Connect
- Somfy Connexoon IO
- Somfy Connexoon RTS
- Somfy TaHoma
- Somfy TaHoma Switch [(instructions)](#tahoma-switch)
- Thermor Cozytouch

### TaHoma Switch

Multiple users reported that the TaHoma Switch will work with this integration **after** you create a scene in the TaHoma app and wait for a few hours. See [#507](https://github.com/iMicknl/ha-tahoma/issues/507) for context.

## Supported devices

Most of the devices supported by your hub should be supported. If it is not the case or working correctly, have a look [here](#device-not-supported--working-correctly).

## Installation

You can install this integration via [HACS](#hacs) or [manually](#manual).

### HACS

This integration is included in HACS. Search for the `Overkiz (by Somfy)` integration and choose install. Reboot Home Assistant and configure the 'Overkiz (by Somfy)' integration via the integrations page or press the blue button below.

## Advanced

### Available services

After installation this integration adds new services to Home Assistant which can be used in automations. The new services are:

+ Overkiz (by Somfy): Set cover position with low speed (tahoma.set_cover_position_low_speed, only added if supported by the device)
+ Overkiz (by Somfy): My position (cover) (tahoma.set_cover_my_position)
+ Overkiz (by Somfy): Execute command (tahoma.execute_command)
+ Overkiz (by Somfy): Get execution history (tahoma.get_execution_history)

## Events
This component listen for events returned by Overkiz. In case of command failure, the event will forwarded to Home Assistant.

You can subscribe to the `overkiz.event` event type in Developer Tools/Events in order to examine the event data JSON for the correct parameters to use in your automations. For example, `overkiz.event` returns event data JSON similar to the following when your cover is blocked.

```JSON
{
    "event_type": "overkiz.event",
    "data": {
        "event_name": "ExecutionStateChangedEvent",
        "failure_type_code": 106,
        "failure_type": "CMDCANCELLED"
    },
    "origin": "LOCAL",
    "time_fired": "2021-09-28T20:03:57.102478+00:00",
    "context": {
        "id": "92a84240d914b43ceaf1aee3249568f6",
        "parent_id": null,
        "user_id": null
    }
}
```

You can find the list of available failure_type [here](https://github.com/iMicknl/python-overkiz-api/blob/main/pyoverkiz/enums/general.py#L34).

### Enable debug logging

The [logger](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/logger/) integration lets you define the level of logging activities in Home Assistant. Turning on debug mode will show more information about unsupported devices in your logbook.

```yaml
logger:
  default: critical
  logs:
    custom_components.tahoma: debug
```

### Device not supported

If your device is not visible in the device list of Home Assistant (/config/devices/dashboard), you need to turn on [debug logging](#enable-debug-logging) first. Copy your Home Assistant log (Configuration > Logs) and create a [new issue](https://github.com/iMicknl/ha-tahoma/issues/new/choose).


### Device not working correctly

If your device is listed in the device list, you need to turn on [debug logging](#enable-debug-logging) first. Copy your Home Assistant log (Configuration > Logs) and create a [new issue](https://github.com/iMicknl/ha-tahoma/issues/new/choose).

In order to gather more information, you can use the `tahoma.get_execution_history` service which will print your execution history to the Home Assistant log. Run the commands via the official vendor app (e.g. TaHoma) and include your log in the issue.


### Retrieve HomeKit code

If your hub (e.g. Somfy TaHoma) supports HomeKit natively, your setup code will be added as a sensor in Home Assistant. Look up your hub in Home Assistant and retrieve the value from the 'HomeKit Setup Code' sensor. You can now configure the [HomeKit Controller](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/homekit_controller/) integration in Home Assistant.
