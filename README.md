# Overkiz (by Somfy) - Home Assistant

Custom component for Home Assistant to interact with smart devices via the Overkiz platform.

>This component builds upon the work of [@philklei](https://github.com/philklei) and is an updated version of the [original Tahoma integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/tahoma/) in Home Assistant with the goal of eventually merging into core. The installation of this component will replace the original TaHoma integration and thus allows you to beta-test [all changes](https://github.com/iMicknl/ha-tahoma/releases).

## Supported hubs

- Somfy TaHoma
- Somfy TaHoma Switch [(instructions)](#tahoma-switch)
- Somfy Connexoon IO
- Somfy Connexoon RTS
- Atlantic Cozytouch
- Hitachi Hi Kumo
- Rexel Energeasy Connect
- Nexity Eugénie

### TaHoma Switch

Multiple users reported that the TaHoma Switch will work with this integration **after** you create a scene in the TaHoma app and wait for a few hours. See [#507](https://github.com/iMicknl/ha-tahoma/issues/507) for context.

## Supported devices

This integration doesn't rely on a hardcoded list of devices anymore, but relies on the characteristics of every device. This means that more devices will be supported out of the box, based on their category, available states and commands. If your device is not supported or working correctly, have a look [here](#device-not-supported--working-correctly).

## Installation

You can install this integration via [HACS](#hacs) or [manually](#manual).

### HACS

This integration is included in HACS. Search for the `Overkiz (by Somfy)` integration and choose install. Reboot Home Assistant and configure the 'Overkiz (by Somfy)' integration via the integrations page or press the blue button below.

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and start setting up a new integration.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/config_flow_start.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/config_flow_start/?domain=tahoma)

### Manual

## Advanced

### Available services

After installation this integration adds new services to Home Assistant which can be used in automations. The new services are:

+ Overkiz (by Somfy): Set cover position with low speed (tahoma.set_cover_position_low_speed, only added if supported by the device)
+ Overkiz (by Somfy): My position (cover) (tahoma.set_cover_my_position)
+ Overkiz (by Somfy): Execute command (tahoma.execute_command)
+ Overkiz (by Somfy): Get execution history (tahoma.get_execution_history)

### Enable debug logging

The [logger](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/logger/) integration lets you define the level of logging activities in Home Assistant. Turning on debug mode will show more information about unsupported devices in your logbook.

```yaml
logger:
  default: critical
  logs:
    custom_components.tahoma: debug
```

### Device not supported

If your device is not visible in the device list of Home Assistant (/config/devices/dashboard), you need to turn on [debug logging](#enable-debug-logging). Copy the debug string from your log and create a [new issue](https://github.com/iMicknl/ha-tahoma/issues/new/choose)

`DEBUG (MainThread) [custom_components.tahoma] Unsupported TaHoma device (io:DimmableLightIOComponent - Light - DimmableLight).`

### Device not working correctly

If your device is listed in the device list, create a [new issue](https://github.com/iMicknl/ha-tahoma/issues/new/choose) and fill in all details of the issue template.

In order to gather more information, you can use the `tahoma.get_execution_history` service which will print your execution history to the Home Assistant log. Run the commands via the official vendor app (e.g. TaHoma) and capture the commands.

```
2021-01-28 09:20:22 INFO (MainThread) [custom_components.tahoma] 2021-01-27 21:30:00: off executed via Home Assistant on io://xxxx, with [].
2021-01-28 09:20:22 INFO (MainThread) [custom_components.tahoma] 2021-01-27 16:23:29: setIntensity executed via Home Assistant on io://xxxx, with [70].
```

### Exclude devices

The previous version had functionality to exclude devices from Home Assistant. Since we moved to the entity registry, this functionality is now offered by default in Home Assistant core. You can now disable entities via the interface.

### Retrieve HomeKit code

If your TaHoma box supports HomeKit natively, the integration will log the HomeKit code on start currently. This is currently an experimental implementation and in order to enable this, you need to have debug logging enabled.
