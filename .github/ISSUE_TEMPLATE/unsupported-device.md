<!--
Please update the title to match your device model and type

A clear and concise description of the device, together with specific usecases that you would like to see supported.


**Device details**

- **Hub**: [e.g. Cozytouch, eedoums, Hi Kumo, Rexel, Somfy Connexoon, Somfy TaHoma]

<!--
Enable debug logging (https://github.com/iMicknl/ha-tahoma#enable-debug-logging) and paste the Unsupported device string here.

If your device already shows up in Home Assistant, share the type (e.g. `io:DimmableLightIOComponent`, which can be gathered from device page in HA looking at Firmware] `/config/devices/dashboard`
-->

**Device commands**
<!--
In order to gather more information, you can use the tahoma.get_execution_history service which will print your execution history to the Home Assistant log. Run the commands via the official vendor app (e.g. TaHoma) and capture the commands.
